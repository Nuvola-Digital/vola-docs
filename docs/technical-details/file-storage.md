# File storage

All the files are stored in the aggregated storage (ipfs, iagon, etc.). When a user uploads a file on the network, the ownership proof is generated in the network and distributed to storage solutions. Ownership proof ensures that a user has rightful access to and control over the file. Itâ€™s typically achieved through cryptographic means such as creating a proof on the blockchain or generating a unique identifier (e.g., a hash) that ties the file to a specific user.

## End-to-End Storage Encryption

Security and privacy are important factors for users managing their files across various storage solutions. Vola Network allows for end-to-end encryption to ensure that user files are protected at every stage of storage and transmission. When a user uploads a file, it is encrypted on their device before being transmitted to the storage provider. Only the user possesses the decryption keys, ensuring that even Vola Network cannot access the contents of their files.
