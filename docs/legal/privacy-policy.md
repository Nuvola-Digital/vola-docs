# Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: [Feb 3, 2025]_

Vola Network is committed to protecting user privacy while operating in its devnet phase. As a decentralized aggregation platform, we prioritize data security, transparency, and minimal data collection. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle user information, data security measures, and user rights while using our platform.

## Data Collection & Usage

Vola Network operates on a decentralized infrastructure, and as such, we strive to minimize data collection. However, during the devnet phase, limited data may be collected for development, security, and platform improvements.

### Types of Data We May Collect:

- **Basic Usage Data** – Logs related to platform interactions, error reports, and performance analytics for debugging purposes.
- **Storage & Compute Metadata** – Non-personally identifiable metadata related to decentralized storage, compute, or GPU resource allocation.
- **Web2 Authentication (If Used)** – If integrated, OAuth-based authentication (Google Drive, Dropbox) may involve minimal data exchange solely for access management.
- **Voluntary User Feedback** – Any information users provide while reporting issues, participating in testing, or engaging with the community.

### What We DO NOT Collect:

- Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (e.g., name, address, email, government ID).
- Private encryption keys or passwords.
- Any stored content uploaded by users unless explicitly shared for development purposes.

## Data Security & Encryption

Vola Network follows industry best practices to ensure user data security and prevent unauthorized access. Our key security measures include:

- **End-to-End Encryption** for decentralized data-sharing.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** to verify ownership without exposing sensitive information.
- **Decentralized Storage** to minimize reliance on centralized servers and reduce risks of data breaches.
- **Access Control Measures** ensuring only users have control over their encrypted files and transactions.

## Third-Party Integrations

Vola Network may integrate with third-party DePIN services (e.g., IPFS, Iagon, cloud storage providers). We are not responsible for how these services handle user data. Users should review their respective privacy policies before engaging with external platforms.

## User Control & Data Portability

- Users remain in full control of their encrypted storage, compute, and GPU resources.
- No centralized entity within Vola Network retains access to private user data.
- Any future updates involving data-sharing policies will be transparent and community-governed.

## Experimental Nature & Potential Risks

As Vola Network is in its devnet phase, security, privacy, and functionality may evolve over time. Users should understand the risks associated with using an experimental blockchain platform, including but not limited to:

    - Potential bugs, vulnerabilities, or downtime during testing.
    - Temporary data loss or access issues due to network upgrades.
    - Future changes to privacy protocols and security implementations.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated as the platform progresses. Any significant updates will be publicly communicated. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically.

## Contact & Community Feedback

For any privacy-related concerns or suggestions, please reach out via our **official community channels** or development team forums.

**By engaging with Vola Network during its devnet phase, you acknowledge and accept the outlined privacy terms.**
