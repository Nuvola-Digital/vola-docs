# Aggregator Node

The Aggregator Node (also known as the Gateway Node) acts as a bridge between users and the underlying decentralized storage solutions. These nodes manage and aggregate users' files across different storage providers, ensuring seamless interactions and synchronization across multiple platforms. Gateway Nodes are responsible for handling usersâ€™ upload requests, ensuring that files are securely stored, and ensuring the blockchain is updated with the latest changes.
