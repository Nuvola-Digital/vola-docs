# Unified Interface

The Unified Interface of Vola Network provides users with an intuitive and seamless way to interact with the Vola Chain and various storage solutions, abstracting the complex technical components of the underlying system. This interface simplifies interactions with both decentralized (e.g., IPFS, Iagon, etc.) and centralized storage providers (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox), allowing users to easily manage their files without needing any blockchain or technical knowledge.

The goal of the Unified Interface is to bridge the gap between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, enabling users to explore decentralized storage options while maintaining a familiar, user-friendly experience. By offering a centralized platform to interact with diverse storage solutions, the Unified Interface ensures that users have the flexibility to choose the best storage provider for their needs, all within a single, cohesive platform.

The Nuvola Drive is currently under development and will integrate with Vola Network as the primary unified interface, providing users with a simple, familiar way to access both decentralized and centralized storage solutions.
