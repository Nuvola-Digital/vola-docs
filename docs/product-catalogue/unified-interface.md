# Unified Interface

The Unified Interface of Vola provides users with an intuitive and seamless way to interact with the Vola Chain and various storage solutions, abstracting the complex technical components of the underlying system. This interface simplifies interactions with both decentralized (e.g., IPFS, Iagon, etc.) and centralized storage providers (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox), allowing users to easily manage their files without needing any blockchain or technical knowledge.

The goal of the Unified Interface is to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, enabling users to explore decentralized storage options while maintaining a familiar, user-friendly experience. By offering a platform to interact with diverse storage solutions, the Unified Interface ensures that users have the flexibility to choose the best storage provider for their needs, all within a single, cohesive platform.
