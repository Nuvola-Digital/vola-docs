# Product Catalogue

## MVP Chain

In the initial mvp product, a substrate chain will be developed with aggregation between decentralized options like IPFS or Iagon to centralized services like Dropbox or Google Drive, supporting multi-chain interactions, using the Cardano blockchain for financial transactions, and implementing Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) circuits for Web 2 OAuth authentication, for transition from Web 2 to Web 3 for users.

## Nuvola Drive

Vola Network will power the back-end to our in-house products, one of which is Nuvola Drive – a Web2 cloud storage app with a web3 back-end.

Nuvola Drive will be an all in one cloud storage aggregator mobile app, set to hit App stores in Q1 2025. Users will have the ability to choose between many decentralized (IPFS, Storj, Arweave, DeNet, etc) and centralized (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc) storage providers. This essentially makes Nuvola Drive the “Uber Eats” of cloud storage. Its ease of use will welcome any and all users, while also showcasing new decentralized solutions options. This familiar yet innovative service will help newer protocol gains exposure while competing on a level playing field with more established service providers.
