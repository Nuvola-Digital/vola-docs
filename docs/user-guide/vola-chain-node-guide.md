# Vola Chain Node Guide

## Running a Vola Chain Node

This guide will walk you through setting up and running a Vola Chain Node using Docker.

### System Requirement

**_All system requirements currently apply to the devnet phase. As we transition to testnet and mainnet, these requirements may evolve, and the document will be updated accordingly._**

- 4 GB Ram
- 2 Core CPU
- 20 GB Storage (50 GB for Archive Node)

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker:**
  For containerization.
- **Docker Compose:**
  For orchestrating multi-container setups.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the Vola Node Docker repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nuvola-Digital/vola-node-docker
cd vola-node-docker
```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   - Copy the _.env.example_ file to _.env_:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   - Open the _.env_ file and update the following variables:

     - **AURA_SURI**: Specifies the SURI for generating Aura keys. This should be 32 bytes in hex format (0x-prefixed with 64 additional 0-f bytes). Eg: `0x1bbae82623cd6e7475cfd80f59da9f0e2b65597a8e681d60b7eb2a5353d64097`

     - **GRAN_SURI**: Specifies the SURI for generating Grandpa keys. This should be 32 bytes in hex format (0x-prefixed with 64 additional 0-f bytes). Can be same as _AURA_SURI_. Eg: `0x1bbae82623cd6e7475cfd80f59da9f0e2b65597a8e681d60b7eb2a5353d64097`

     - **NODE_NAME**: The name of the node. This is used to identify your node within the network.

     - **NODE_KEY**: Secret key to use for p2p networking. The value is parsed as a hex-encoded Ed25519 32 byte secret key (64 hex chars).Eg: `5c507c46d949698a3ff6ae2e5cc9808b26b3b33c0623440dc4c563c1a0d0b2be`

     - **KEYSTORE_PASSWORD**: The password used to unlock the node's keystore.

     - **PORT**: The port number used for the node's peer-to-peer network communication (default is 30333).

     - **RPC_PORT**: The port number for remote procedure calls (RPC), which is used for interacting with the node (default is 9944).

     - **PROMETHEUS_PORT**: The port number for prometheus exporter, for monitoring node (default is 9615).

     Ensure that these variables are properly configured to match your environment and security requirements.

3. **Generate SURI and Node Key:**

   - To generate the required SURI for Aura and Grandpa keys:

   ```bash
       docker run --rm -it nuvoladigital/vola-node key generate
   ```

   This will output a secret seed, which is the required SURI.

   - To generate the node key:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it nuvoladigital/vola-node key generate-node-key
   ```

   This will provide the node key, which is the second value output by the command.

4. **Start the Node:**
   With your environment variables configured, you can start the node by running Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will bring up the Vola node and begin syncing with the network.

5. **Access the Node:**
   Once the node is up and running, you can interact with it using the RPC port (default: 9944).
