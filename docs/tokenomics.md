#### Community Incentives (45%) – 945 million $VOLA

- **Purpose:** The largest portion of the supply is dedicated to community incentives, which may include rewards for network participants, early adopters, users who contribute to the ecosystem, staking rewards, and other mechanisms that foster community growth.
- **Use Cases:** This allocation could be used for staking rewards, airdrops, liquidity mining, incentive programs, and rewarding long-term users or contributing community members.

#### Treasury (13%) – 273 million $VOLA

- **Purpose:** The treasury is typically reserved for future funding of the network, enabling the project to meet unforeseen costs, support the ecosystem, or fund strategic initiatives.
- **Use Cases:** It may be used to fund future development or partnerships, or to cover operational costs as the network scales.

#### Development Fund (11%) – 231 million $VOLA

- **Purpose:** The development fund is allocated to fund ongoing development, including technical work such as protocol upgrades, smart contract development, security audits, and research into new features or technologies.
- **Use Cases:** This fund ensures that the network can continue evolving, supporting new updates or features, and incentivizing developers to contribute to the ecosystem.

#### Team (9%) – 189 million $VOLA

- **Purpose:** The team allocation is meant to reward the core team responsible for building the Vola Network. This ensures that the team remains incentivized to continue working on the project long-term.
- **Use Cases:** The tokens for the team may be subject to vesting periods, ensuring that the team is aligned with the long-term success of the project.

#### Community (5% NVL Holders) (7%) – 147 million $VOLA

- **Purpose:** This portion is dedicated to rewarding NVL token holders (or other legacy token holders, if applicable). This is an important allocation to maintain continuity and reward the community that helped build the platform’s early success.
- **Use Cases:** It could be distributed to NVL holders in airdrops, staking rewards, or other forms of community participation.

#### Marketing & Advisory (5%) – 105 million $VOLA

- **Purpose:** The marketing and advisory allocation will fund marketing campaigns, community growth initiatives, and advisory services from key industry experts and influencers. This helps increase the visibility of the Vola Network and attract new users, partners, and investors.
- **Use Cases:** Funds may be used for advertising, partnerships, influencer promotions, event sponsorships, and other forms of outreach.

#### Liquidity Pool (LP) (5%) – 105 million $VOLA

- **Purpose:** The liquidity pool allocation is essential for ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity in the market for users to buy, sell, or trade $VOLA tokens on decentralized and centralized exchanges.
- **Use Cases:** Tokens allocated to LPs will be used to create liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs), allowing users to easily trade $VOLA. It can also be used for liquidity farming and market making to ensure price stability.

#### Venture Capital (VC) (5%) – 105 million $VOLA

- **Purpose:** The venture capital allocation is dedicated to investors or partners who provide initial funding or strategic support to the project.
- **Use Cases:** VC funds are often used for early-stage project funding, partnerships, and strategic investments that help the project grow. This allocation is generally locked up with a vesting schedule to prevent large, early sell-offs and ensure long-term commitment.

:::note[**Vesting Periods**]

Many of the allocations (such as for the team, VC, and marketing) are likely subject to vesting periods or lock-up periods to prevent market flooding and ensure long-term commitment. This means that those holding tokens for these purposes can’t immediately sell all their tokens but will receive them over time.

:::info[**Incentivizing Growth**]

The 45% allocated to community incentives and 7% to NVL holders demonstrates that Vola Network is highly focused on rewarding its community, incentivizing early participation, and driving adoption. This allocation is critical for network growth and user acquisition.

:::note

The integration of Cardano for transaction settlements may play an important role in the financial ecosystem of $VOLA. It could mean that part of the tokenomics will also incentivize liquidity and interactions within the Cardano ecosystem, potentially integrating with Cardano's DeFi solutions or dApp ecosystem.
