# Phase I Development Milestones

_Last Updated: [Feb 7, 2025]_

## Devnet - completed

- **Custom Substrate Chain:** File ownership and distribution indexing.
- **Aggregator Node:** Support for IPFS storage driver.
- **Storage Aggregation:** Storage system supporting aggregator node onboarding, tracking.
- **Web2 Integration:** Google authentication and login to sync files from google drive to decentralized storage.

## Currently in development

- **End-to-End File Encryption:** Ensuring secure storage and retrieval of user data.
- **Payment Dispute Flow & UI Development:** Implementing user-friendly dispute resolution for payments.
- **Upload Interruption UI Flow:** Enhancing user experience during file uploads (includes file upload cancels and interruptions).

## Future plans

### Storage-Related Enhancements

- **Reputation Model:** Rating system for both users and aggregator nodes for smooth network operation.
- **ZKP Authentication & Wallet Module:** Enable Web2 users to interact securely with Web3 storage.
- **Consensus Model:** Implement a proof-of-file and node liveliness mechanism.
- **Additional Storage Provider Integration:** Onboarding IAGON as an additional storage provider.
- **Redundancy & Backup System:** Implementing data replication across nodes for high availability.
- **Metadata Indexing & Search:** Enabling fast and efficient file searches across stored data.

### Compute and GPU

- **Extend Aggregator Module:** Enable compute and GPU aggregation across different DePIN services (first partners yet to be decided).
- **Aggregate First Compute Partner**
- **Aggregate First GPU Partner:** AI, ML, and high-performance workloads.

### Blockchain

- **Security and Privacy:** ZKP-Based Authentication & Web2 Wallet Integration: Allowing users to interact with the network securely using Web2 authentication.
- **Reputation Model for Nodes:** Tracking node downtime consistencies and other performance variables for smooth network operation.
- **Optimised Consensus Mechanism:** Improved proof-of-file and node liveliness models for energy efficiency and scalability.
- **TGE and Tokenomics Plan:** Establish a detailed use-case plan for $VOLA, including staking, governance, payments for decentralized storage, compute, and GPU access.

### Network Upgrades

- **Partner Chain Integration:** Cardano to be used as a financial settlement layer.
- **Multi-Chain support:**
  - **EVM Integration:** Enabling interaction with Ethereum-compatible chains.
  - **Polkadot Integration:** Expanding support to the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Testnet Release
