These investors may venture capitalists, angel investors, or early supporters who provided essential funding to help the project take off. The purpose of this allocation is to compensate them for their risk and support while the project was in its nascent phase.
- **Use Cases:** The funds raised during the early seed round are used for initial development costs, legal fees, market research, and setting up the infrastructure necessary for launching the project.

:::note[**Vesting Periods**]

Many of the allocations (such as for the team, VC, and community) are subject to vesting periods or lock-up periods to prevent market flooding and ensure long-term commitment. This means that those holding tokens for these purposes can’t immediately sell all their tokens but will receive them over time.

:::info[**Incentivizing Growth**]

The 46% allocated to community incentives and 6% to NVL holders demonstrates that Vola Network is highly focused on rewarding its community, incentivizing early participation, and driving adoption. This allocation is critical for network growth and user acquisition.

:::note

The integration of Cardano for transaction settlements may play an important role in the financial ecosystem of $VOLA. It could mean that part of the tokenomics will also incentivize liquidity and interactions within the Cardano ecosystem, potentially integrating with Cardano's DeFi solutions or dApp ecosystem.
